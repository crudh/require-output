require-output
==============
A simple RequireJS plugin that loads resources from a matching output directory structure.

This can be used together with, for example, a Grunt watcher plugin that compiles or transforms files on demand to a matching "compiled" directory structure. This way the entire output directory can be git ignored and original files and output files won't be mixed.
